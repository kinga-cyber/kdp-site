          <h2>The Client</h2>
          <p>MoxieLash is an innovative beauty brand established in 2018, known for creating super-strength magnetic eyelashes and Lashies™ with Nano-grip Lash Technology™. As a pioneer in the magnetic lash industry, they needed a strategy to stand out against emerging competitors.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>MoxieLash faced the common e-commerce startup problem: while their magnetic lashes generated initial market buzz, they needed to compete with emerging copycats. The core challenge involved retaining customers and converting them into repeat buyers rather than relying solely on acquisition.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Kinga Dow recommended LoyaltyLion as their loyalty platform partner due to its scalability, flexibility, superior Shopify Plus integrations, deep Klaviyo integration for marketing automation, and extensive customization capabilities.</p>

          <h3>Program features included:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Tiered loyalty structure with gamification</li>
            <li>Personalized loyalty emails using Klaviyo integration</li>
            <li>Shopify Plus Points Slider for checkout redemption</li>

            <li>Weekly automated email campaigns with 12 loyalty data points</li>
          </ul>

            <li><strong>1.5x higher average orders</strong> from members vs. non-members</li>
            <li><strong>1.5x higher average spend</strong> from members vs. non-members</li>
            <li><strong>3x higher repeat purchase rate</strong> (first to second purchase)</li>
            <li><strong>700% increase</strong> in completed loyalty activities</li>
            <li>Selected as <strong>"Best Use of Emails"</strong> winner in LoyaltyLion Hall of Fame 2020</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
          <p>Integration of loyalty data with email marketing drove significant engagement. Weekly communication, triggered email flows, and multi-site linking optimization created sustained business growth for a competitive beauty market.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>

It was important for the company to leverage the expertise of partners with proven experience scaling eCommerce brands.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Kinga Dow Productions implemented a "Lottery" gamification strategy using Klaviyo email flows. The approach featured:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A popup offering "mystery discounts" in exchange for email addresses</li>
            <li>Customers discovered discount amounts only at checkout</li>
            <li>48-hour validity window after opt-in</li>
            <li>Discount range: $5-$100 (80% redeemed lower-tier discounts)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This mechanism leveraged psychological commitment bias, encouraging customers to complete the purchase experience.</p>

          <h2>The Results</h2>
          <h3>Email Performance:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>First email: <strong>62% open rate, 42% click rate</strong></li>

          <h3>Subscriber Growth:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>List grew from near-zero to <strong>400K</strong> between March-August 2020</li>
            <li>Mobile: 411.56K subscriptions (23.4% submission rate)</li>
            <li>Desktop: 36.69K subscriptions (12.1% submission rate)</li>
