          <h2>The Client</h2>
          <p>A premium gift basket e-commerce brand serving both B2C and corporate (B2B) customers with an average order value of $454. Their business is occasion-driven — holidays, corporate gifting, and special events — meaning customers typically purchase only once or twice per year, making traditional subscription or loyalty models ineffective.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The brand's email marketing was underperforming relative to its potential. Email revenue sat at $346K, representing only 10.8% of total revenue with a 28.1% open rate. Their flow architecture was campaign-heavy (60% campaigns, 40% flows), segmentation was basic, and there was no system for identifying high-value customers versus one-time buyers. With 75–80% of Q4 revenue generated within a 36-day holiday shipping window, they needed a smarter system to maximize every customer touchpoint.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Starting in May 2025, we built a comprehensive AI-powered email marketing system using Claude as a daily strategic partner. This wasn't about using AI for simple tasks — it was about creating a custom intelligence system that transformed the entire retention marketing approach.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Built proprietary RFM + CLV segmentation system adapted for gift-based businesses — each segment received dedicated flows AND campaigns, making RFM the foundation everything else was built on</li>
            <li>Designed automated flows around RFM segments ensuring each customer lifecycle stage had targeted communication and retention triggers</li>
            <li>Enhanced existing flows for Q4 — First Purchase with holiday messaging and gift wrapping reminders, Welcome Pop-Up optimized for holiday traffic, WinBack targeting last year's holiday customers, Browse Abandonment with reduced trigger delays and urgency messaging, Abandoned Cart with shipping deadlines and increased incentives</li>
            <li>Built new sequences including Corporate Gifting Nurture for B2B revenue</li>
            <li>Integrated Reviews.io and optimized all review metrics with automated review request flows, review-triggered cross-sell sequences, and review-based customer segmentation</li>
            <li>Created segment-specific pop-up strategy with Spin-to-Win pop-ups for Black Friday and Christmas campaigns, plus dedicated pop-ups tailored to each RFM segment</li>
            <li>Connected Claude to Klaviyo, GA4, Asana, and Slack through MCP integrations, building a full business intelligence system across departments</li>
            <li>Built comprehensive Q4 projections using verified multi-source data — conservative, moderate, and aggressive scenarios that gave the client confidence to prepare for growth</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>273% email revenue growth</strong> — from $346K to $1.29M in 12 months</li>
            <li><strong>Email attribution doubled</strong> — from 10.8% to ~30% of total revenue</li>
            <li><strong>69% of email revenue from automated flows</strong> — up from 40% in 2024</li>
            <li><strong>Q4 exceeded aggressive projection by 11%</strong> — actual Q4 revenue hit $2.4M vs $2.27M projected</li>
            <li><strong>Client had to pause email marketing for 6 days</strong> during peak holiday season because fulfillment couldn't keep up with order volume — and we still beat the aggressive target</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
          <p>The real power of AI in retention marketing isn't using it for one-off tasks — it's building a comprehensive intelligence system through sustained strategic partnership. Seven months of daily work with Claude created proprietary RFM segments, projection models, MCP-connected business intelligence, and a flow architecture that generates revenue automatically. When we had to stop sending emails during peak season, the automated systems kept working — December flows generated 81% of email revenue. The foundation matters more than tactics, and the methodology that created 4x growth is the true competitive advantage.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Kinga Dow recommended LoyaltyLion as their loyalty platform partner due to its scalability, flexibility, superior Shopify Plus integrations, deep Klaviyo integration for marketing automation, and extensive customization capabilities.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>SMS marketing remained underutilized despite proven benefits like high open rates and advanced analytics</li>
            <li>Required sourcing appropriate technology with privacy compliance as priority to avoid legal issues</li>

          <h2>The Client</h2>
          <p>An iconic Hawaiian footwear brand celebrating 80 years in business (founded 1946), known for handcrafted leather slippers made with premium materials. Now in its third generation of ownership, the brand serves customers worldwide from their Hawaiian headquarters with a lean e-commerce operation managed by a dedicated but stretched operator.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The brand's operator was using ChatGPT in a limited way — mostly for Meta ad copy and email campaigns based on prompts from a business coaching group. She knew AI had potential but didn't understand how to use it strategically or systematically. Ad performance was declining, manual processes were unsustainable for a lean team, and she constantly felt overwhelmed trying to track everything that needed to be done. There was no structured system for campaign planning, ad analysis, or marketing decision-making.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Starting with an analysis of the brand's existing acquisition channels — Google Ads, Meta Ads, email flows, and campaigns — we provided clear, actionable recommendations to improve ROAS and then built an entire AI-powered marketing infrastructure from the ground up.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Built complete AI-powered marketing system producing structured social media briefs, email briefs, and ad briefs</li>
            <li>Created weekly ad analysis process enabling confident decisions to kill losing ads, iterate on new ideas, and double down on winners</li>
            <li>Automated email campaign workflows using Claude AI and Asana integration</li>
            <li>Developed strategic marketing calendar with promotional campaigns aligned to seasonal patterns</li>
            <li>Replaced guesswork with a data-driven decision framework powered by AI analysis</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>40% year-over-year sales increase</strong> through AI-powered marketing systems</li>
            <li><strong>Transformed operator confidence</strong> — from overwhelmed and reactive to confident and data-driven</li>
            <li><strong>Structured decision-making</strong> — weekly ad analysis replaced gut-feeling choices</li>
            <li><strong>Automated workflows</strong> — campaign creation time reduced dramatically through Claude AI + Asana integration</li>
            <li><strong>10+ year partnership that keeps evolving</strong> — from email marketing to Klaviyo migration to reviews/loyalty programs to full AI-powered systems</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
          <p>The most powerful AI transformation isn't about the technology — it's about the partnership. Over a decade, this relationship evolved through every major shift in digital marketing because both sides committed to continuous growth. The operator went from basic ChatGPT prompts to running a complete AI-powered marketing system, not because of a single tool implementation, but because of sustained coaching that built real capability.</p>

          <h2>The Client</h2>
          <p>A specialty gift company focusing on gourmet food baskets and curated gift collections. Operating in the competitive e-commerce gift market, the business is highly seasonal with predictable holiday spikes and needed to differentiate through superior customer experience and data-driven marketing.</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>By mid-2024, the brand faced several critical email marketing challenges. Deliverability issues meant campaigns weren't reaching customer inboxes. There was over-reliance on email with no SMS strategy, heavy dependence on manual one-time campaigns versus automated flows, basic segmentation without customer lifecycle understanding, and unclear attribution of marketing impact on revenue. The result was stagnant email performance despite a growing customer base, with limited scalability and missed opportunities for retention and cross-selling.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>We implemented a three-phase transformation over 18 months, focusing on infrastructure first, then integration, then intelligence — building systematically rather than jumping to advanced tactics.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Resolved deliverability issues through complete email infrastructure audit, list cleaning, proper authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and consistent sending patterns</li>
            <li>Launched SMS channel with welcome series, abandoned cart sequences, and time-sensitive promotions — creating a cross-channel customer journey</li>
            <li>Rebuilt entire flow architecture including welcome series, enhanced abandoned cart, browse abandonment, post-purchase, retention, and customer lifecycle automation</li>
            <li>Integrated Reviews.io with automated review request flows, review-triggered cross-sell sequences, and review-based customer segmentation</li>
            <li>Implemented advanced RFM analytics with 17 distinct customer segments, predictive analytics, and Facebook lookalike audience integration</li>
            <li>Connected Claude AI analytics through MCP for real-time Klaviyo data access, automated reporting, and data-driven optimization workflows</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>205% year-over-year growth</strong> in attributed revenue</li>
            <li><strong>84.45% of revenue from automated flows</strong> — up from a campaign-heavy model, proving the power of automation-first strategy</li>
            <li><strong>21.58% of revenue from SMS</strong> — a channel that didn't exist before, complementing rather than cannibalizing email</li>
            <li><strong>$43,670 in attributed revenue</strong> in a single 30-day period with a 25.39% attribution rate</li>
            <li><strong>17 active RFM segments</strong> enabling precise targeting, predictive analytics, and cross-platform integration with Facebook advertising</li>
            <li><strong>Reviews.io cross-sell flow</strong> achieving 6.0% click rate (vs. typical 2–3%), indicating strong customer engagement with social proof</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
          <p>The 205% growth wasn't achieved through a single tactic — it came from methodical infrastructure building. By solving foundational issues first (deliverability, automation), then adding strategic integrations (SMS, Reviews.io), and finally layering intelligence (RFM analytics, Claude AI), each phase amplified the one before it. The shift from campaign-heavy to flow-heavy (84.45% from automated flows) created scalable, sustainable growth that doesn't depend on manual effort. Foundation first, complexity later — that's how you turn a seasonal gift business into a consistent revenue driver.</p>

          <p>Kinga Dow Productions implemented a "Lottery" gamification strategy using Klaviyo email flows. The approach featured:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A popup offering "mystery discounts" in exchange for email addresses</li>
            <li>Customers discovered discount amounts only at checkout</li>
            <li>48-hour validity window after opt-in</li>
            <li>Discount range: $5-$100 (80% redeemed lower-tier discounts)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This mechanism leveraged psychological commitment bias, encouraging customers to complete the purchase experience.</p>

          <h2>The Results</h2>
          <h3>Email Performance:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>First email: <strong>62% open rate, 42% click rate</strong></li>
            <li>11.5% of users placed orders from initial email</li>
            <li>Revenue from Lottery flow: <strong>$4.93M</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Subscriber Growth:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>List grew from near-zero to <strong>400K</strong> between March-August 2020</li>
            <li>Mobile: 411.56K subscriptions (23.4% submission rate)</li>
            <li>Desktop: 36.69K subscriptions (12.1% submission rate)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Loyalty Integration:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>44K new loyalty program members</li>
            <li>Additional $1.2M revenue from loyalty program purchases</li>
            <li><strong>Total revenue: $5.53M</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
          <p>Strategic email marketing combined with engaging gamification mechanics proved remarkably effective for rapid customer acquisition and retention, even during unprecedented economic disruption.</p>

            <li>Opt-in forms offering discount codes</li>
            <li>Automated follow-up emails</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The team also conducted A/B testing on creative assets to optimize performance.</p>

          <h2>The Results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Christmas page:</strong> 28.57% conversion rate</li>
            <li><strong>Anniversary page:</strong> 3.64% visitor signup increase</li>
            <li><strong>Pet page:</strong> 6.58% conversion increase (post A/B testing)</li>
            <li><strong>Overall impact:</strong> 138% more website visitors converted into leads</li>
          </ul>
